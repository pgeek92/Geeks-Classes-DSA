# Geeks Classes DSA Online Tutorials
[Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)) and various companies hiring challenges solved in Java language

This is my repo full of Data Structures problem practices that I'm currently practicing prior to or during an interview, as well as general problem snippets. I hope that all these problems (and solutions) are useful to others for practice and review. Feel free to contribute any solutions and optimisations, and add your own problems that you find as well, as I would love to see them.
